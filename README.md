Tools Used: Power BI | Power Query | DAX | Excel

##Project Overview
This project demonstrates how multiple university datasets can be integrated and analysed in Power BI to explore student engagement patterns at the University of Manchester Students’ Union. It connects data on student demographics, society membership, research satisfaction, and election participation to uncover meaningful insights into student involvement.

A mock dataset (~300 students) was created to emulate realistic university data, including some inconsistencies and missing values, allowing for hands-on data cleaning and transformation in Power BI. The datasets were modelled in a star schema with student id as the bridge between the tables.

##Summary
By linking academic, survey and engagement data, this Power BI project highlights how integrated dashboards can inform the Students’ Union about student participation, satisfaction, and community engagement. It provides a framework for data-driven decisions to improve student life and increase election participation.
